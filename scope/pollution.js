/*For example, globally scoped variables can collide with other variables that are more locally scoped, causing unexpected behavior in our code.

Let’s look at an example of scope pollution in practice so we know how to avoid it:
*/

let num = 50;
 
const logNum = () => {
  num = 100; // Take note of this line of code
  console.log(num);
};
 
logNum(); // Prints 100
console.log(num); // Prints 100

/*
You’ll notice:

We have a variable num.
Inside the function body of logNum(), we want to declare a new variable but forgot to use the let keyword.
When we call logNum(), num gets reassigned to 100.
The reassignment inside logNum() affects the global variable num.
Even though the reassignment is allowed and we won’t get an error, if we decided to use num later, we’ll unknowingly use the new value of num.
