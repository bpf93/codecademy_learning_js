//Comparison operators compare the value on the left with the value on the right. For instance:

10 < 12 // Evaluates to true

//We can also use comparison operators on different data types like strings:

'apples' === 'oranges' // false

let hungerLevel = 7

if (hungerLevel > 7) {
  console.log('Time to eat!');
} else {
  console.log('We can eat later!')
}  // output 'We can eat later!'
